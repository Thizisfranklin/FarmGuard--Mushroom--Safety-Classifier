# Project Title

Mushroom Classification Challenge

## One Sentence Summary

This repository holds an attempt to classify mushrooms as edible or poisonous based on various physical characteristics using Random Forest and Naive Bayes models on the Kaggle Mushroom Classification dataset ([https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/mushroom-classification](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/mushroom-classification)).

## Overview

**Task Definition:** The task defined by the Kaggle challenge is to use various categorical features of mushroom samples—such as cap shape, odor, gill size, and stalk surface characteristics—to predict whether a mushroom is edible (`e`) or poisonous (`p`).

**Approach:**
We formulated this as a binary classification problem. After encoding categorical variables and handling missing data, we compared the performance of two algorithms:

1. **Random Forest Classifier** – ensemble of decision trees.
2. **Gaussian Naive Bayes** – probabilistic model assuming feature independence.

**Performance Summary:**
Our best model (Random Forest) achieved near-perfect classification performance on the held-out test set, with precision, recall, and F1-score all exceeding 0.99.

## Summary of Work Done

* Data loading and exploratory analysis
* Data cleaning: handled missing stalk-root values, encoded categorical features
* Feature selection: removed redundant and low-importance features
* Model training and evaluation: compared Random Forest vs. Naive Bayes
* Generated submission file for Kaggle challenge

## Data

* **Type:** CSV file (`mushrooms.csv`) of categorical features.
* **Input:** 22 features (e.g., cap shape, odor, gill size) encoded as single characters.
* **Output:** Edible (`e`) or Poisonous (`p`) label.
* **Size:** 8,124 samples.
* **Split:** 80% training (6,499 samples), 10% validation (812 samples), 10% test (813 samples).

### Preprocessing / Cleanup

* Converted target and selected features to numeric labels.
* One-hot encoded high-cardinality categorical features (`odor`, `gill-color`, etc.) using `pd.get_dummies`.
* Dropped the `stalk-root` feature due to extensive missing values (`?`).

## Data Visualization

* Crosstabulations for each feature against the class label.
* Histograms and bar plots highlighting distribution differences 


## Problem Formulation

* **Input:** Preprocessed feature matrix (`X`) with one-hot and label-encoded variables.
* **Output:** Binary label (`y`): 0 = edible, 1 = poisonous.
* **Models:**

  * Random Forest Classifier
  * Gaussian Naive Baye

## 1. Training Set Confusion Matrix

Naive Bayes: ![Training Set Confusion Matrix](https://github.com/Thizisfranklin/Tabular-Kaggle-Project-Mushroom-Classification-Challenge-/blob/main/Testing%20confusion%20matrix.png)

```
 Predicted ⟶   0 (edible)    1 (poisonous)
True 0 (edible)      3366               0
     1 (poisonous)     76            3057
```

* **True Negatives (TN):** 3366 (edible correctly classified)
* **False Positives (FP):** 0 (no edible misclassified as poisonous)
* **False Negatives (FN):** 76 (poisonous misclassified as edible)
* **True Positives (TP):** 3057 (poisonous correctly classified)

> **Interpretation:** On the training data, the model never falsely labels an edible mushroom as poisonous (perfect precision), but it misses 76 poisonous samples (recall ≈ 0.98).

## 2. Validation Set Confusion Matrix

Naive Bayes: ![Validation Confusion Matrix](https://github.com/Thizisfranklin/Tabular-Kaggle-Project-Mushroom-Classification-Challenge-/blob/main/Validation%20confusion%20matrix.png)

```
 Predicted ⟶   0 (edible)    1 (poisonous)
True 0 (edible)       421               0
     1 (poisonous)     11             380
```

* **TN:** 421
* **FP:** 0
* **FN:** 11
* **TP:** 380

> **Interpretation:** On held‑out validation data, the model again achieves perfect precision (no false positives) and recalls 380/391 poisonous samples (\~97%).

---

## 3. Testing Set Confusion Matrix

Naive Bayes: ![Testing Set Confusion Matrix](https://github.com/Thizisfranklin/Tabular-Kaggle-Project-Mushroom-Classification-Challenge-/blob/main/Testing%20confusion%20matrix.png)


```
 Predicted ⟶   0 (edible)    1 (poisonous)
True 0 (edible)       421               0
     1 (poisonous)      9             383
```

* **TN:** 421
* **FP:** 0
* **FN:** 9
* **TP:** 383

> **Interpretation:** Final test performance is consistent: zero false positives, and only 9 poisonous mushrooms missed (recall ≈ 0.98).

## Summary Metrics

From these confusion matrices, the key metrics for the “poisonous” class are:

| Split      | Precision | Recall | F1‑Score |
| ---------- | --------- | ------ | -------- |
| Training   | 1.00      | 0.98   | 0.99     |
| Validation | 1.00      | 0.97   | 0.99     |
| Testing    | 1.00      | 0.98   | 0.99     |

* **Precision = 1.00** (model never raises a false alarm on edibles)
* **Recall ≈ 0.97–0.98** (a handful of poisonous mushrooms go undetected)

**Note:** To reduce false negatives (missed poisonous cases), consider threshold tuning or cost‑sensitive methods, or compare against ensemble models like Random Forest.

* **Hyperparameters:**

  * Random Forest: `n_estimators=100`, `max_depth=None`, `random_state=42`
  * Naive Bayes: default parameters

## Training

* **Environment:** Python 3.8, scikit-learn 1.0, run on a standard CPU machine.
* **Duration:** \~10 minutes for Random Forest on 6,499 samples.
* Training and validation curves plotted to monitor overfitting.
* Early stopping based on validation accuracy plateau.

## Performance Comparison

* **Metrics:** Accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score.

| Model                | Train Acc | Val Acc | Test Acc |
| -------------------- | --------- | ------- | -------- |
| Random Forest        | 1.00      | 1.00    | 1.00     |
| Gaussian Naive Bayes | 0.98      | 0.98    | 0.98     |

* **ROC Curves:** Plotted for both models showing near-perfect AUC.
* # Machine Learning

This section describes the end‑to‑end ML pipeline applied to the Mushroom Classification challenge.

## Problem Formulation

1. **Remove unneeded columns**

   * Dropped constant or redundant columns (e.g. `veil-type`), and any row identifiers (none present).

2. **Encode categorical features**

   * All 22 descriptive features (cap-shape, odor, gill-color, etc.) were one-hot encoded via `pd.get_dummies()`.

3. **Encode target**

   * Mapped `class` values: `e` → 0 (edible), `p` → 1 (poisonous).

4. **Train / Validation / Test split**

   * Shuffled with fixed `random_state` for reproducibility and split:  80% train / 10% validation / 10% test.

## Train ML Algorithm

* **Model:** RandomForestClassifier (100 trees, `random_state=42`).
* **Rationale:** Quick, robust baseline to verify end‑to‑end pipeline.

```python
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier

rf = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
rf.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

* **Goal:** Obtain a non‑trivial result rather than fully optimized performance at this stage.

## Evaluate Performance on Validation Sample

1. **Metrics:** accuracy, precision, recall, F1‑score:

   ```python
   from sklearn.metrics import classification_report
   print(classification_report(y_val, rf.predict(X_val)))
   ```

## Conclusions

* Random Forest outperformed Naive Bayes, achieving perfect classification on the test set.
* High feature separability in the mushroom dataset makes this classification problem relatively straightforward.

## Future Work

* Experiment with other tree-based ensembles (e.g., XGBoost).
* Investigate feature importance further and conduct dimensionality reduction.
* Deploy model to a web service for real-time classification app.
