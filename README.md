# Cutting Losses from Mis-Sorted Mushrooms: A Farm-Ready AI Classifier

## The Situation
A mid-sized mushroom farm in North Texas was losing money and trust. Sorters working by sight and smell struggled to tell edible from poisonous look‑alikes. In peak weeks, manual sorting created two costly errors:
- **False negatives (missed poisonous):** rare but catastrophic—forced recalls, destroyed inventory, and reputational damage.
- **False positives (edible discarded):** common and expensive—reduced yield and lower revenue per harvest.

> In a typical week of ~25,000 caps, ~1.0–1.5% were mis‑sorted, translating to **$[X,XXX]** in lost product plus periodic recall costs of **$[YY,YYY]**. (Replace with your numbers.)

## Business Goal
Reduce weekly financial losses and safety risk by **catching nearly every poisonous mushroom** (maximize recall) while **preserving yield** (minimize unnecessary discards). Throughput and simplicity matter: the line shouldn’t slow down.

## Hypothesis
Visual and morphological traits (odor, gill size, cap shape/color, bruising) are **separable enough** to support a fast, reliable classifier. If tuned for **very high recall on “poisonous”** and paired with a **gray‑zone recheck**, we can cut both false negatives (safety) and false positives (yield).

## What I Built (3‑Week Pilot)

I built a tool that helps farms tell edible mushrooms from poisonous ones. It learns from example data and flags anything risky; if it’s unsure, it sends the item to a quick manual recheck. In testing it hit ~99% accuracy, cutting mistakes, improving safety, and saving more good product
1) **Data & EDA**
- Used the Kaggle “Mushroom Classification” dataset as a proxy for morphology/odor patterns.
- One‑hot encoded categorical fields; dropped heavy‑missing `stalk-root`.  
- **Visuals that drove decisions (representative):**

**What the visuals proved (in business terms):**
- **Odor** and a few morphology traits have large, directional effects.  
  → Prioritize these for early rules or lightweight pre‑screens to speed operations.  
- Clear separation suggests a **simple ensemble** will be high‑accuracy with modest engineering effort.  
  → Spend time on **thresholds, monitoring, and recheck design** rather than model complexity.

2) **Models & Decision Policy**
- Benchmarks: **Random Forest (100 trees)** and **Gaussian Naive Bayes** with an 80/10/10 train/val/test split.
- **Policy:** Prefer higher **recall for “poisonous.”** Introduced a **gray zone**—predictions in a middle probability band automatically route to **manual recheck**.
- Kept Naive Bayes as a QA cross‑check alongside Random Forest.

3) **Ops Integration**
- Output per tray: **POISONOUS**, **EDIBLE**, or **RECHECK** (traffic‑light UI).
- A one‑page dashboard tracks **poisonous recall**, **false‑positive rate (yield loss)**, and **borderline volume**.
- Weekly calibration: adjust threshold to hit policy targets (e.g., **≥99% recall** on poisonous).

## Before → After (Pilot, Placeholder Numbers)
Replace the placeholders with your real metrics.

| Metric (weekly)                         | Before (Manual) | After (AI + Gray Zone) |
|----------------------------------------|------------------|-------------------------|
| Poisonous recall (safety)              | ~96–97%          | **≥99.5%**              |
| False positives (edible thrown out)    | ~1.0%            | **0.4–0.6%**            |
| Items escalated to recheck             | –                | **3–5%**                |
| Throughput per hour                    | Baseline         | **+8–12%**              |
| Net weekly loss from mis‑sorting       | $[X,XXX]         | **$[~40–60% lower]**    |

> **Why this works:** EDA shows odor and a few morphology traits carry most of the signal. That lets a Random Forest achieve near‑perfect accuracy on held‑out data, while the gray‑zone policy absorbs rare borderline cases without risk.

## Technical Snapshot
- **Preprocessing:** One‑hot encode categorical features; map target `e→0`, `p→1`; drop `stalk-root` (heavy missing).  
- **Models:** Random Forest (100 trees), Gaussian Naive Bayes.  
- **Split:** 80/10/10 train/val/test with fixed `random_state` for reproducibility.  
- **Observed results (reference run):** RF ≈ **1.00** test accuracy; GNB ≈ **0.98**.  

### Reproduce
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
# download mushrooms.csv from Kaggle into ./data/
python src/preprocess.py
python src/models.py  # trains RF & Naive Bayes, prints metrics
```

## Risk, Governance, and Monitoring
- **Asymmetric costs:** False negatives (missed poisonous) cost **10–100×** more than false positives (discarded edible). We optimize for **poisonous recall** and tolerate slightly higher FP if needed.
- **Controls:**
  - **Gray zone:** middle‑probability band (e.g., 0.40–0.60) routes items to recheck.
  - **Threshold tuning:** maintain ≥99% poisonous recall on validation; adjust weekly.
  - **Drift checks:** monitor odor/gill distributions and borderline share; alert on shifts.
- **Explainability:** Feature importance + example cases help line leads trust and train.

### Financial Impact Template
- **Yield saved:** (Baseline FP% − New FP%) × edible volume × $/kg.  
- **Risk avoided:** (Baseline FN% − New FN%) × poisonous volume × expected recall/penalty cost.  
- **ROI:** (Yield saved + risk avoided − recheck labor) / implementation cost.  
Early estimates indicate a **payback period < [N] months** with continued gains as thresholds are tuned.

## Roadmap
- Cost‑sensitive learning and calibrated probabilities to further cut false negatives.
- Add camera‑based embeddings for robustness to lighting/background shifts.
- Build a small **audit dataset** from farm imagery to fine‑tune the model to local conditions.
- Optional mobile “line lead” app for on‑the‑spot rechecks with photo capture.

### Summary
Built a farm‑ready mushroom classifier that frames decisions with **asymmetric costs**. Random Forest achieved near‑perfect accuracy; a **gray‑zone recheck** policy pushed poisonous recall to ≥99% while preserving yield. Clear EDA patterns (odor, morphology) explain the model’s success and guide sustainable operations.
